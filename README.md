Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and an interactive Jupyter notebook for simulating reactive contaminant plumes using Mathieu-function series . You can run each script standalone or import it as a library and call a single run(...) function with parameters from a notebook. To access the Jupyter Notebook online, please launch it using the follow Binder tag: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AlvinYadav/AEM-Jupyter/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FCompiled_results_JCH.ipynb).

For quicker computational times, locally downloading the files and running it is recommended.
